Improvements postponed after complation of the 2021 book
1) Protect the data (hopeless issue)
2) Interactive stats about the database (Trends - ChartJS)
4) Featured result at the top
5) Live search .. two countries.. needs a blank (not critical)
6) Empty requests possible for submitting study?
7) Random "next study" offers?
8) Chat..!
9) "advancedSearch" parameters groups may be 2 colors in order (maybe not necessary)

66) Don't forget to remove the pause
67) 2019 and 2020 National Poster Winners were not included
68) Remove only (1) results. Especially in criteriaMethod
69) Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) ?
70) All "compliance" are "policiesAudits" ?
71) All "history" are "patientIntervention" ?
72) Fix back, all Biologicals are NOT biosimilars. Point is where the focus is.
73) Check back "meta analysis", for "network meta analysis"
74) Add back "Hepatic Impairment"
75) There is "Survival Analysis" but is it related to PFS and OS?
76) Should remove "clinicalTrials" if it was "Literature Search"ed?
77) Should add "department" to the "Paediatrics"
78) 2021 journal did not include "Compounding" section with "0" results. Please chech that again later.
79) wards --> "intensive care" --> there are many to be united
80) "Beta lactam inh." and "Beta lactamase inh." are the same. Unite!
81) Hover on result and see the parameters as a list
82) Should "policiesAudits" checked and removed the ones includes about medical "guidelines" ? "Evaluation of prescription adequacy to the antibiotherapy protocol in intra-abdominal infection in a regional hospital" and before
83) "Data were obtained from the electronic medical records" is a reason for "ePrescribing" key?
84) Sort arrays by name and check for the duplicates

For search demonstration
1) "Cost effectiveness analysis of meropenem dose optimisation in critical patients -- "administrative"
2) "Use of oseltamivir in the treatment of influenza A" -- "instutional" 2 hospitals - 251 patients
3) "Switching to equivalent alternatives: antiretroviral optimisation strategy" - "costAnalysis" - says: optimisation but not "cost"
4) "Changing from cobicistat to a ritonavir boosted regimen in HIV positive patients" -- "outpatient" switch is being made for outpatients, not in the wards
5) Test: Retrospective studies for the end-of-life patients
6) "Evaluation of a pharmaceutical care programme for patients being treated with omalizumab" -- "selfmedication" under the stated Phar.Programme
7) Artificial intelligence fails: "Pharmaceutical interventions in drugs provided to the outpatient hospital pharmacy" -- text contains "oncology" but can't be listed in Oncology
8) In doubt: "Analysis of antibiotic consumption in a nursing home" .. "antimicrobial stewardship programmes are necessary" it says so should I add the "stewardship" key?
9) "Preliminary design of hospital telepharmacy" -- there is no "telepharmacy"
10) "Nutritional risk evaluation in institutionalised elderly patients in a public nursing home" -- there's "intervention" but not stated in the title

For examples demonstration
1) "habits" for "AIDS"
2) "biosimilars" for "Rituximab" maybe plus "costAnalysis"
3) "medicalDevices" "safetyProfile" sounds cool (maybe + "multidisciplinary")
4) "errors" in "geriatrics"
5) "riskSafety" for "compounding"
6) "nextStep" for "shortages"
7) "costAnalysis" for "oncology"
8) "education" for "youngPharma"
9) "offLabel" for ? (actSubs)
10) "costAnalysis" for "clinicalTrials" (?)
11) "education" for "youngPharma"
12) "costAnalysis" for "resistance"
13) "policiesAudits" for "biosimilars" plus "biosimilars"
14) "compounding" with "shortages"
15) "nextStep" for "shortages"
16) "administrative" "policiesAudits"
17) "Clopidogrel" "pharmacogenetics" studies

"advantages demonstration" for in-promotion
1) A pharmacist started in Medical Devices Department and don't know what to do. "selection" or "costAnalysis"
